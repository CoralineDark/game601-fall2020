        Based on the classic card game "War", the Game of War: Reimagined is a more stragetic take on a game which historically acts more like a simulation than a game. This version gives the player more agency and focuses heavily on the mechnanics of war chains and informed reshuffling.

        Frankensteining Frenzy is a game about card effects and creature creation! The players construct their Frankenstein’s Monsters out of 5 different parts - a Head, a Torso, Legs, a Right Arm, and a Left Arm – and each part can be equipped with an accessory to further boost its abilities. At the start of each turn, the players declare if they are going to attempt to Draw, Discard, Create, or Battle, and whichever phases are declared are carried out, assuming the conditions to do so are met. These phases are always done in order of Drawing -> Discard Effect -> Creation -> Battle. Players pit their partial creatures against one another in a race to create the strongest completed Frankenstein’s Monsters, accessories and all! This is a game where you might find a Man Lion wearing a top hat fighting an Angelic, Fridge Pegasus or simply two arms trying to arm wrestle for dominance! What kind of creature will you create?

        Worlds? Yes, you heard that right! In this mechanically-driven, puzzle platformer, navigate your way through two different worlds - at the same time. Everything your character does, your ‘reversi’ does the opposite, but the worlds around them are not the same. Safely navigate both characters to the end of each level win!
